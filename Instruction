Hello everyone.
This is a project that is used as Face Recognition by training out own model.
Prerequities: ** Python libraries : keras, cv2, numpy ** should be pre installed on the base system.
I'm using jupyter notebook for creating the model and face detection.

We will be using MobileNet, which is an architecture suitable for mobile and embedded based vision applications where there is a lack of computing power, for facial recognition.
We will be also using VGG16, which is a convolutional neural network model for classification and detection of objects.
   ** To detect the face **
    
1) Create a file named "Face Recognition" and copy paste from Face Recognition.ipynb then save.
2) Use " SHIFT + ENTER " to move to next cell in the jupyter notebook.
3) Firstly we collect our dataset, but you can download the dataset from the internet, but I'm collecting it using python code usign cv2 and numpy.
4) After collection of dataset, divide the dataset into train and validation set for training and testing the dataset.
5) Then we load the model and do further precedings as mentioned on the top of the code.

Although both the models MobileNet and VGG16 are good but VGG16 is much better than MobileNet and powerful.
This suggestion is just to get better prediction.
Better accuracy and prediction based on the network and the architecture used for creating the model.


I would like to Thank Mr. Vimal Daga sir for this Intresting task.
